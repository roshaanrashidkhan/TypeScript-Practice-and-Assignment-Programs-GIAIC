// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function car_detail(manufacturer: string, modelName: string, ...options:[string, any][]):Object{
    let car_detail = {manufacturer, modelName}
    options.forEach(([key, value]) => car_detail[key] = value);
    return car_detail;
}

console.log(car_detail("Honda", "Civic", ["color", "blue"], ["year", 2020]));
